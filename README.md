# Introduction

Mobile Center command line interface is a unified tool for running Mobile Center services from the command line. Our aim is to offer a concise and powerful tool for our developers to use Mobile Center services and easily script a sequence of commands that they'd like to execute. You can currently login and view/configure all the apps that you have access to in Mobile Center.

Although our current feature set is minimal, all the existing Mobile Center services will be added going forward. Note that the Mobile Center CLI is currently in public preview.

# Prerequisites

Mobile Center CLI requires Node.js version 6.3 or better. Do not use Node.js 7.1.0, there is a known issue that breaks the CLI code (and many other projects) on Windows 10. This bug has been fixed in later releases of Node.js 7.

# Installation

```
npm install -g mobile-center-cli
```

Once installed, use the `mobile-center` command. See below for the available commands.

# Getting Help

To get a top level list of the available commands, run `mobile-center help`.

To get help on a specific command or category, run `mobile-center help command` or pass the `-h` flag to any command or category name.
